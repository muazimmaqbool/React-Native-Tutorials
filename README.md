# React Native Tutorials

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of tutorials and code samples to help you learn and master React Native, a framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. The tutorials are designed to help both beginners and intermediate developers understand core concepts and best practices in React Native app development.

## Expo

All tutorials and example projects in this repository are built using [Expo](https://expo.dev/), a powerful set of tools and services built around React Native. Expo makes it easy to start, develop, and deploy React Native applications with minimal setup.

## Key React Native Concepts Covered

This repository demonstrates and explains essential React Native concepts, including:

- **Components**: Building and composing functional and class components.
- **State and Props**: Managing dynamic data and passing information between components.
- **Navigation**: Implementing navigation between screens using React Navigation.
- **Styling**: Styling components with Flexbox, StyleSheet, and responsive design principles.
- **Handling User Input**: Working with TextInput, Button, and other form elements.
- **Lists & ScrollView**: Rendering lists efficiently with FlatList, SectionList, and ScrollView.
- **APIs and Data Fetching**: Fetching data from remote APIs using `fetch` and handling asynchronous actions.
- **Lifecycle Methods & Hooks**: Using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and understanding component lifecycle.
- **Assets and Media**: Working with images, icons, and other assets in a cross-platform way.
- **Expo Modules**: Using Expo's built-in modules for camera, location, notifications, and more.
