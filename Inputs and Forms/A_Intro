Inputs in React Native:

  ->In web development, we have lots of html elements at our disposal to capture user input
    example: input fields, text areas, dropdown menus, checkboxes, radio groups and many more

  ->In React Native, the core RN library only provides TextInput and Switch (main topics to discuss in this section)
  ->What about the other inputs components ?
    ANS: EXPO expands our toolkit, offering additional components like checkboxes, and date pickers etc through the EXPO SDK.

Forms in React Native:
    ->Here we focus on :
    1) Managing Form State: controlling the dynamic data within our forms
    2) Handling Form validation: integrity and validity of the user's input
    3) Displaying Validation Messages: results of validation to the user
    4) Submitting Form Data: sending the collected information where it need to go
